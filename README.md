Time Series Forecasting (Banana Republic)


We can conclude that best forecast for this model is:
* municipality id: 1
* worst forecast is for municipality id: 4

I used ForecasterAutoreg for time series forecasting. And used gridsearch for hyperparameter tuning also used backtesting.

Alternative time series forecast models can also be tested for comparison. However I didn't cover them for simplicity. 
(LSTM, GAN, Prophet, ARIMA models)
