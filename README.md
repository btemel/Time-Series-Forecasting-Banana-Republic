Time Series Forecasting (Banana Republic)


To start, open up a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the directory of your Python project. Once you are there, type the following command:  

pip install -r requirements.txt



We can conclude that best forecast for this model is:
* municipality id: 1
* worst forecast is for municipality id: 4

I used ForecasterAutoreg for time series forecasting. And used gridsearch for hyperparameter tuning also used backtesting for cross validation.

Alternative time series forecast models can also be tested for comparison. However I didn't cover them yet for simplicity. 
(LSTM, GAN, Prophet, ARIMA models)
